# rust_slr

This started as a project to help me understand some of the underlying concepts to simple linear regression while also practicing Rust. I realize that a lot of what I'm doing is probably a naive approach to linear regression as well as not being super idomatic in the Rust programming language. I'm hoping to eventually expand this out to include:
- Support for accepting a datframe and names of columns
- Support for multiple linear regression
- Statistical tests for linear regression
- Better output
- Integration of linear algebra for solving OLS
